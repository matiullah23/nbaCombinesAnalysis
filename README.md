##Initial Plan

Analyzing 2012-2016 NBA Combines using dataset found here : https://data.world/achou/nba-draft-combine-measurements

##Updated Plan
 
I found raw data on NBA.com that I was able to manually scrape and format in Excel to match the data I already had to expand the years examined from 2012-2016 to 2000-2018.
